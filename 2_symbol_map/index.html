        <h1>What will we be looking at based on the World Economic Dataset?</h1>
        <p class="gtext">
            From this dataset, there will be 5 key topics which will be visualised.
            Firstly, the Corruption Index in the world, then the cost of living amang different
            countries in the world. Other than that, we would also be looking at the richest countries 
            in the world which will be measured using each countries gross domestic product. Lastly,
            we will be looking at the number of tourist visiting respective countries around the world
            and each countries unemployment rate. Note: not all countries are included in the dataset.

        <p>Corruption Index In Various Countries Around the World</p>
        <p class="gtext">
            The graph on the right shows the corruption Index of different countries around the globe.
            The information embeded in the graph contains the corruption index and the annual income.
            By clicking around the map, we are able to see the a visualisation of the corruption index.
            Eventhough just by looking at the annual income it is not enough to draw a proper conclusion 
            on whether the annual income affects the corruption index.

        <h1>Worlds Richest Countries</h1>
        <p class="gtext">
            Here among 60 countries in the dataset, the top 10 countries were selected and visualised! The most 
            richest country in the world goes to <b>LEXUMBORG</b> mainly due to big tech componies exanding 
            their operations in Lexumborg. Lexumborg has favourable tax conditions which allows those big tech
            componies to avoid paying taxes on their profits! Coming in second place is none other than <b>Singapore</b>.
            The few reasons Singapore was able to gather this much success comes down to a few reasons, 
            having a <b>strong</b> and <b>pragmactic</b> Leadership and also <b>capitalising</b> on their strategically 
            located port. Lastly, the third most richest country according to the dataset is <b>Ireland</b> whom managed
            to become really succesful finacially due to being one of the largest exporters of pharmaceuticals, medical
            devices and software-related goods and services. Currently they hold a very diversed economy even amidst the 
            global pandamic.

            What does unemployement mean? People who are unemployed are people of working age who are without work, are able
            to work and has already taken specifics steps to find work. This is important to a country because the spending 
            power of an unemplyed individual decreases drastrically which gives a negative impact on the society. Unemployement 
            can also lead to recession as well. The government is also at a disadvantage as they would have to increase their 
            spendings in order to aide the unemployed. From the bar chart below, it can be said that the country with the highest 
            unemplyment rate in Marshall Islands. The visualation below can be used by sliding the slider to display the top x countries
            with the highest unemployment rate. It is also noted that the richest countries typically have a low unemployment rate.
