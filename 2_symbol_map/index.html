        <p>What will we be looking at based on the World Economic Dataset?</p>
        <p class="gtext">
            From this dataset, there will be 5 key topics which will be visualised.
            Firstly, the Corruption Index in the world, then the cost of living amang different
            countries in the world. Other than that, we would also be looking at the richest countries 
            in the world which will be measured using each countries gross domestic product. Lastly,
            we will be looking at the number of tourist visiting respective countries around the world
            and each countries unemployment rate. Note: not all countries are included in the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>Corruption Index In Various Countries Around the World</p>
        <p class="gtext">
            The graph on the right shows the corruption Index of different countries around the globe.
            The information embeded in the graph contains the corruption index and the annual income.
            By clicking around the map, we are able to see the a visualisation of the corruption index.
            Eventhough just by looking at the annual income it is not enough to draw a proper conclusion 
            on whether the annual income affects the corruption index.
